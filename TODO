New scoring script ideas:
-------------------------

- Most recent allruners, most recent ziggurat:27 visits.

General thoughts:
 - top_killers:
     - number of kills, kill %,
 - gkills:
     - Ghost with the most kills.
 - winners:
     - nwins, name, games, win%, urune max, top score, average score.

 - escapes_turns:
     -
 - escapes_score
 - streaks (overall best streaks)
 - clevels (Character level stats)
 - species (Species stats)
 - classes (Class stats)
 - gods (God stats)
 - runes (Rune stats)
 - specie_class (Combo stat?)
 - specie_class_table (Whuh?)
 - per_day (line chart of activity)
 - recent (recent wins, recent ended games)


Later
