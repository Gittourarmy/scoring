New scoring script ideas:
-------------------------

General thoughts:
- Most recent allruners, most recent ziggurat:27 visits.
- Player of the month, tracked historically?
  - Based on points?
- Script will be based on tourney scripts. It should be able to use any
  number of scorefile/milestone paths.
- Script should run fairly fast so as to not load cao.
- DB size will be kept minimal, using incremental updates instead of
  queries on fully-populated tables where possible.
- Output pages should contain all data currently available on cao scoring
  pages:
 - top100
 - players.html: top total scores:
     - total score, player, best score, games (won), win %, av score,
       last game

   This table can be updated in two ways:
   - Full update on first run.
   - Incremental update when catching up to new logfile entries.
       
 - top_combinations: Top score for each combo, broken up by race:
       combo, top score, player, date
 - combo_scoreboard: Scoreboard for players with most race/class/combo
                     highscores
       # of highscores, player, species
       # of highscores, player, class
       # of highscores, player, combos
 - all_players: List of all players (alphabetic)
 - players.html: List of players (top total score)
 - players_best_score: List of players (best score)
 - per player page:
     - Ten best games.
     - Ten most recent games.
     Break up of:
     - Highest CL.
     - Escapes with orb.
     - Games played
     Break up by race and class.
