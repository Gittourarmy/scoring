Running the scoring scripts:

1. Make sure MySQL is up and running, with a db 'scoring' with access
   to the user 'scoring' with no password (and make sure MySQL is
   listening only on localhost or has TCP connections disabled).

    create database scoring;
    create user scoring;
    grant all privileges on scoring.* to scoring;

2. mysql -uscoring scoring < database.sql will (re)create the tables,
   discarding any existing data.

3. python scoresd.py will start a daemon to update the db continuously
   from the logfile and milestones. scoresd.py is otherwise identical
   in behaviour to scbootstrap.py.

Other scripts:

For a one-off scoring update, you can run python scbootstrap.py.
