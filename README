Running the scoring scripts:

1. Make sure MySQL is up and running, with a db 'scoring' with access to
   the user 'scoring' with no pw.

2. mysql -uscoring -p scoring < database.sql will (re)create the tables,
   discarding any existing data.

3. ./link-setup will link the various logfiles into the current directory
   for the scoring scripts to work on.

4. python scoresd.py will start a daemon to update the db continuously from
   the logfile and milestones. taildb is otherwise identical in behaviour
   to scbootstrap.py.

Other scripts:

For a one-off scoring update, you can run python scbootstrap.py.
